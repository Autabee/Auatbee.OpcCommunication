<h2>FAQ</h2>
<h3>How can I connect to an OPC Server?</h3>
in the case that you have an opc ApplicationConfiguration you can use the following code:
<code>
    <pre>
        var logger = new Logger();
        var client = new OpcClient(GetConfig(),logger);
        
        await client.Connect("opc.tcp://localhost:4840");
    </pre>
</code>
Otherwise use the following code:
<code>
    <pre>
        string company = "company that the client is from";
        string product = "name of the client";
        string directory = "directory there the config need to be saved";
        var client = new OpcClient(company,product,directory,logger);
        
        await client.Connect("opc.tcp://localhost:4840");
    </pre>
</code>


<h3>Why do you use Serilog?</h3>
It's a great logging framework that is easy to use and has a lot of options. It's also easy to extend. And since this is the logging tool of choice for the company it originally is made for, we kept it in.
